RxNova Conditions Application Automation

This test suite implements HashMaps at the actor and page levels to create an association between labels and xpaths on any page. This facilitates the passing of WebElement Object paths to 
functions as parameters, therefore allowing us to recognize elements at an earlier stage than just the page level. Strings used in feature files are passed in as keys, which can be used to 
access objects on a page.
